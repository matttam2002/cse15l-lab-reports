# Part 2 
I took 519 seconds for the first style and I face the difficulties of scp the large folder to the remote and it takes some time. 

I took 320 seconds for the second style and I don't face any difficulties.

Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?

I prefer the second style, because it more easily to edit the file in remote and save it in the remote server. If I do it locally and scp the file after editing, it takes a lot of time comparing to editing remotely. 

What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)

I think if there's a lot editing and test the program by running it. I think doing in local will be better, as every time i need to run the vim file, i need to save and exit. Then, run it in the terminal. It is really not that convenient.
